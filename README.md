# Triangles

This app will let a user input the sides of a triangle, and will produce a drawing of the specified triangle along with
the side lengths and angles. Above the drawing, it will inform the user whether or not the given inputs create a valid
triangle, and if so, what kind of triangle it produces (Acute, Right, or Obtuse; and Scalene, Isosceles, or Equilateral)
. It will not accept any input that is negative, nor will it accept any input that is not a number.
